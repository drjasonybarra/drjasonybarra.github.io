Here are a few web apps I created for my introductory astronomy courses. These are designed to provide a lab type experience using real data. They are written in Python using the Dash/plot.ly package and deployed using Heroku.

## Spectral Typing Nearby Stars

In this app there are two dropdown menus, one containing a list of spectra for some of the nearest stars, and the second containing a list of spectral types. The goal is to visiaully match the spectrum of a nearby star to its spectral type obtaining not only spectral type but the surface temperature associated with the spectral type. 

This has been used in an activity where students create their own H-R diagrams. The apparent magnitude, along with parallax are given on a table, allowing students to calculate absolute magnitude. Then using the results of the spectral typing activity, they can construct their diagrams.
