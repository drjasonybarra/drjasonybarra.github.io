title: Which Knee?

Which knee angers you?  
Which knee keeps you up at night?  

The knee pressed into the ground  
to elevate,  
or  
the knee pressed into a neck,  
to suffocate?  

Which knee angers you?  
Which knee will cause you to speak?  

The knee that promotes  
humanity,  
or  
the knee that commits  
atrocities?  

Which knee angers you?  
Which knee is a threat to you?  
 
The knee that demands accountability,  
or  
the tool used in brutality?  

Which knee angers you?  
Which knee will cause you to act?
